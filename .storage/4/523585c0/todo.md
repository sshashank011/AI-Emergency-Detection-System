# AI-Powered Emergency Detection System - MVP Todo

## Overview
Create a web-based demo showcasing the AI-powered emergency detection system with real-time monitoring, alert management, and admin controls.

## Core Files to Create/Modify

### 1. Main Application Structure
- **src/App.jsx** - Update main layout for emergency detection system
- **index.html** - Update title to "Emergency Detection System"

### 2. Dashboard Components
- **src/components/EmergencyDashboard.jsx** - Main dashboard with live monitoring
- **src/components/ThreatDetectionPanel.jsx** - Real-time threat detection display
- **src/components/AlertSystem.jsx** - Alert management and notifications
- **src/components/LiveFeedMonitor.jsx** - Simulated camera feeds
- **src/components/AudioAnalysis.jsx** - Audio threat detection visualization
- **src/components/SystemMetrics.jsx** - Performance metrics (CPU usage, accuracy)

### 3. Admin & Configuration
- **src/components/AdminPanel.jsx** - Role-based admin controls
- **src/components/ContactConfig.jsx** - Emergency contact configuration
- **src/components/IncidentHistory.jsx** - Historical incident review

### 4. Data & Simulation
- **src/data/emergencyData.js** - Mock data for threats, alerts, incidents
- **src/utils/simulationEngine.js** - Real-time simulation of detection events

## Key Features to Implement
1. Real-time threat detection visualization (92% accuracy display)
2. Silent alert system with 30-second response time simulation
3. Live camera feed simulation with overlay detection
4. Audio analysis waveforms and threat indicators
5. System performance metrics (<35% CPU usage)
6. Emergency contact management
7. Incident history and reporting
8. Role-based access controls

## Technical Approach
- Use React state management for real-time updates
- Implement WebSocket simulation for live data
- Create responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Use Recharts for performance visualizations
- Simulate AI model outputs with realistic data
