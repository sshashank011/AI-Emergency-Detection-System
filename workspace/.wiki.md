# Project Summary
The AI Emergency Detection System is a real-time, AI-powered solution that utilizes computer vision and audio analysis to detect emergency situations such as threats, violence, or distress silently. This system is designed for environments like schools, workplaces, and public transport, providing automated alerts to security personnel without drawing attention to the situation. It leverages advanced technologies like TensorFlow and OpenCV to ensure high accuracy and low latency in threat detection and response.

# Project Module Description
- **Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard**: Displays live threat detection, audio analysis, and system performance metrics.
- **Silent Alert System**: Sends automated alerts to emergency contacts within 30 seconds of detection.
- **Admin Panel**: Allows configuration of system settings and management of user access.
- **Analytics**: Provides insights into detection accuracy, system performance, and incident history.
